########################################
There are many useful features of Spring Boot. Some of them are mentioned below:
Auto-configuration – 
  Spring Boot automatically configures dependencies by using @EnableAutoconfiguration annotation and reduces boilerplate code.
Spring Boot Starter POM – 
  These Starter POMs are pre-configured dependencies for functions like database, security, maven configuration etc.
Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) – 
  This command line tool is generally for managing dependencies, creating projects and running the applications.
Actuator – 
  Spring Boot Actuator provides health check, metrics and monitors the endpoints of the application. 
  It also simplifies the troubleshooting management.
Embedded Servers – 
  Spring Boot contains embedded servers like Tomcat and Jetty for quick application run. No need of external servers.
