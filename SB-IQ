🧠 1. What are the Features of Spring Boot?
############################################
There are many useful features of Spring Boot. Some of them are mentioned below:
✅ Auto-configuration 
      ➡️ Spring Boot automatically configures dependencies by using @EnableAutoconfiguration annotation and reduces boilerplate code.
✅ Spring Boot Starter POM(Project Object Model) 
      ➡️ These Starter POMs are pre-configured dependencies for functions like database, security, maven configuration etc.
✅ Spring Boot CLI (Command Line Interface) 
      ➡️ This command line tool is generally for managing dependencies, creating projects and running the applications.
✅ Actuator 
      ➡️ Spring Boot Actuator provides health check, metrics and monitors the endpoints of the application. 
      ➡️ It also simplifies the troubleshooting management.
✅ Embedded Servers 
      ➡️ Spring Boot contains embedded servers like Tomcat and Jetty for quick application run. No need of external servers.

🧠 2. Why Spring Boot over Spring?
###################################
Spring Boot simplifies the spring features for the user.

Below are some key points which spring boot offers but spring doesn’t:

🔥 Starter POM.
🔥 Version Management.
🔥 Auto Configuration.
🔥 Component Scanning.
🔥 Embedded server.
🔥 InMemory DB.
🔥 Actuators
 
🧠 4. SB Annotations
#####################
✅ @SpringBootApplication 
    ➡️ @SpringBootApplication annotation combines @Configuration, @EnableAutoConfiguration and @ComponentScan annotations.

✅ @AutoConfiguration
    ➡️ This annotation automatically configuring beans in the class path and automatically scans the dependencies according to the application need.

✅ @Autowired
    ➡️ Spring provides annotation-based auto-wiring by providing @Autowired annotation. 
    ➡️ It is used to autowire spring bean on setter methods, instance variable, and constructor. 
    ➡️ When we use @Autowired annotation, the spring container auto-wires the bean by matching data-type.

✅ @Bean
    ➡️ It is a method-level annotation. 
    ➡️ It is an alternative of XML <bean> tag. 
    ➡️ It tells the method to produce a bean to be managed by Spring Container.

✅ @Component
    ➡️ It is a class-level annotation. It is used to mark a Java class as a bean. 
    ➡️ A Java class annotated with @Component is found during the classpath. 
    ➡️ The Spring Framework pick it up and configure it in the application context as a Spring Bean.

✅ @ComponentScan
    ➡️ This annotation scans the components (@Component, @Service, etc.) in the package of annotated class and its sub-packages.

✅ @Controller
    ➡️ The @Controller is a class-level annotation. It is a specialization of @Component. 
    ➡️ It marks a class as a web request handler. It is often used to serve web pages. 
    ➡️ By default, it returns a string that indicates which route to redirect. It is mostly used with @RequestMapping annotation.

✅ @Configuration
    ➡️ This annotation configures the beans and packages in the class path. It is a class-level annotation. 
    ➡️ The class annotated with @Configuration used by Spring Containers as a source of bean definitions.

✅ @Required
    ➡️ It applies to the bean setter method. It indicates that the annotated bean must be populated at configuration time with the required property, else it throws an exception BeanInitilizationException.

✅ @Repository
    ➡️ It is a class-level annotation. The repository is a DAOs (Data Access Object) that access the database directly. 
    ➡️ The repository does all the operations related to the database.

✅ @Service
    ➡️ It is also used at class level. It tells the Spring that class contains the business logic.

✅ @EnableAutoConfiguration
    ➡️ It auto-configures the bean that is present in the classpath and configures it to run the methods. 
    ➡️ The use of this annotation is reduced in Spring Boot 1.2.0 release because developers provided an alternative of the annotation, 
    ➡️ i.e. @SpringBootApplication.
    ➡️ @SpringBootApplication: It is a combination of three annotations @EnableAutoConfiguration, @ComponentScan, and @Configuration.

Spring MVC and REST Annotations
===============================
✅ @RequestMapping:
    ➡️ It is used to map the web requests. It has many optional elements like consumes, header, method, name, params, path, produces, and value.  
    ➡️ We use it with the class as well as the method.

✅ @RequestBody:
    ➡️ It is used to bind HTTP request with an object in a method parameter. Internally it uses HTTP MessageConverters to convert the body of the request.
    ➡️ When we annotate a method parameter with @RequestBody, the Spring framework binds the incoming HTTP request body to that parameter.

✅ @ResponseBody: 
    ➡️ It binds the method return value to the response body. 
    ➡️ It tells the Spring Boot Framework to serialize a return an object into JSON and XML format.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            
✅ @PathVariable: 
    ➡️ It is used to extract the values from the URI. It is most suitable for the RESTful web service, where the URL contains a path variable.
    ➡️ We can define multiple @PathVariable in a method.

✅ @RequestParam: 
    ➡️ It is used to extract the query parameters form the URL. It is also known as a query parameter. It is most suitable for web applications. 
    ➡️ It can specify default values if the query parameter is not present in the URL.

✅ @RequestHeader: 
    ➡️ It is used to get the details about the HTTP request headers. We use this annotation as a method parameter. 
    ➡️ The optional elements of the annotation are name, required, value, defaultValue. For each detail in the header, we should specify separate annotations. 
    ➡️ We can use it multiple time in a method

✅ @RestController: 
    ➡️ It can be considered as a combination of @Controller and @ResponseBody annotations. 
    ➡️ The @RestController annotation is itself annotated with the @ResponseBody annotation. 
    ➡️ It eliminates the need for annotating each method with @ResponseBody.

✅ @RequestAttribute: 
    ➡️ It binds a method parameter to request attribute. It provides convenient access to the request attributes from a controller method. 
    ➡️ With the help of @RequestAttribute annotation, we can access objects that are populated on the server-side.
